# Slim www

A site that contains very similar data to the ~www~ site but doesn't do all the network requests during source and transform nodes. This allows us to test performance much more easily.

# Running the benchmark

First, install node modules required by package.json. This is needed only one time. Then run the build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
